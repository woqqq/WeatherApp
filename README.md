# WeatherApp
Weather Web Application with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript

This is a partner project with Oltian Kadriu. It was the first time for me working with an online API and it was very interesting. Our goal of this project was to program a working weather forecast which shows the weather of the next four days. We kind of missed this goal, because we chose the wrong API for this kind of program and our weather forecast always shows the weather in the next 3/6/9 hours. We only realised our mistake after the whole project was getting finalised so we missed the opportunity to fix that but it is still working so it is fine. We also planned to host the website on a free host website but we didn't have the time for it so maybe we'll do it in the future.
